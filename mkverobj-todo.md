# TODO in this mofo

- [x] last things fuckin' first: we have to figure out how to get the macOS linker to do the same shit – fuck ld, it will never work the same across platforms and architectures.
- [ ] get incfile stuff portable (win32 should be fun)
    - [ ] on macOS, version_data can’t have an underscore prefix. on linux, it has to. in the incfile it has one.
    - [ ] version files should go into `build/obj`
    
- [ ] the logging is fucked.
- [ ] needs errors/warnings/debug
- [ ] the fuck with std:: everywhere
- [ ] better instructions when printing usage
- [ ] rename it. mvs?
