# TODO

- [ ] change `VERFILE` in `Makefile` once weâ€™ve settled on a name; `version` is too common and may cause problems.
- [ ] better instructions when printing usage
- [ ] rename it. mvs?
- [ ] compiler command line option (default  = cc)
- [x] is it really `_WINDOWS_` this whole time?
- [x] remove ifdef SYSTEST_USE_X guard
